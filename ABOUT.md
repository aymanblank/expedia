My Chosen Language is Node js for the backend and React js for the front end.

Why Node JS ?
Node JS server is very simple to create and you can get it up and running in no time, in one single file and just a few lines you can initialize a server that has a great performance and easy to understand.

Why React JS ?
It's the new thing that all javascript developers prefer to work with, it has a great structure and a lot of support
in my case i chose it because am so familer with it and i can write any website in a very efficient and fast manner using it.

In the begining of creating this simple site the first thought that came to my mind is how can i accomplish it as fast as i can with a great structure and performance, that is when i went with node js and react js because both of them are coded using javascript which i'm currently working with a lot and they are realiable for modern websites.

So i started with creating a store that will hold the data coming back from the api with the action that will bring it to the store and for that i installed redux and axios packages to help me go through with the process, then i started creating the UI components that will display the form and the retrieved hotels, by this moment i started setting text fields and date pickers to get user inputs then store them in the state of the component to send them as params to the Node JS server that will handle calling Expedia API and retrieving the responded data to my call in the react js side. then i worked on restricting user inputs to valid values only so i can send them knowing that each piece of data holds a valid value and it will not cause issues in the backend side. after that i started working on the backend (Node JS) to call Expedia API and have the values sent back successflly to any calling party.

I made lots of test cases in both the back end and the front end sending empty objects to the API or sending some values and leave the others empty and it all went just fine.
